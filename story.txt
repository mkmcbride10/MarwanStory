Once upon a time, there was a man named Olaf, who lived in the Swedish town of Fjorfsklamp. He worked as a butcher, and specialized in exotic imported meats. One day as he was walking through bustling downtown Fjorfsklamp, something caught his eye in the middle of the road. It was his wife Fionadorf flirting with his best friend Spinkendorf. His marriage had been struggling for years, and he couldn't remember the last time she had said I love you, but seeing his wife shamelessly flirting with his best friend sent him into a deep, deep depression. 
Olaf approached them. At this time, he burst into tears, and at the same time, many memories related to Spinkendorf appeared in his mind. He still remembered that when Fionadorf was the wife of Spinkendorf, Fionadorf said that he would let her go and no longer be entangled with Spinkendorf.
Obviously that entanglement still persisted today. Olaf threatened to leave Fionadorf and take all of his Swedish krona with him. Fionadorf insisted there was nothing between her and Spinkendorf, and that she was just trying to catch up. Olaf did not believe her and proceeded to soil his pantaloons out of sadness.
